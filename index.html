          more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

          “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a
          transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
          for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
          The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
          the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

          Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning

          “ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program gave me the
          confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The
          standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart

          Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!

        <p class="testimony__description">
          “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals
          who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who
          can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were
          very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
          outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve
          often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land
          a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
